## Extra Information ##

This was the first command line program we built for the Makers Academy course. Applying the theory learned so far to build a working program was massively rewarding for me. It was encouraging to see that what I had learned was starting to have real world applications.

There were certain steps in this challenge (Step 8 and Step 14) which required us to show that we were capable of performing a number of unreleated tasks with the program. As a way of demonstrating the problem solving skills we have developed so far. These parts of the task were very compelling and I relished reseraching ways in which to solve problems and then figuring out how to apply these solutions to my code in the most effective ways.

One task I struggled with the most involved us changing our code so that the user could provide file names with which they wanted to load information from or save information to. It took me some itme to research ways in which to effectively meet this challenge. But through some study in Ruby Docs and Stack Overflow I was able to solve the problem.

This task itself was excellently done and I very much enjoyed supporting a number of other makers in my cohort who were struggling in areas I had too. Working through the problems with them without just giving them the answer greatly solidified my understanding of my code.
